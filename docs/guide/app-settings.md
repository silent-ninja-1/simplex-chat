### Use from desktop (or Link a mobile on desktop app)

This screen allows you to link your mobile device to your desktop, so that you can continue conversing with your contacts and groups on there.  

#### Prerequisite(s):

- Both your mobile device and desktop must be on the same network. For example, if your mobile device is connected to Wi-Fi and your desktop is connected to Ethernet, then they won't link up. 

#### To link your mobile device to your desktop:

1. Download and install the [SimpleX Chat desktop app](https://simplex.chat/downloads/#desktop-app), if you haven't already. 

2. Open SimpleX Chat on your desktop. 

3. If you don't have any chat profiles setup on the desktop app, click **Link a mobile**. 

4. Options:
   
   - Set a new database passphrase.
   
   - Use a randomly generated passphrase.  

5. Set **This Device Name** to whatever you want.

6. On your mobile device, [open the app settings menu](./app-settings.md#opening-the-app-settings-menu).

7. Click or tap **Use from desktop**. 

8. Scan the QR code on your desktop.  

### Migrate to another device

This screen allows you to migrate your SimpleX Chat data from your old device to your new device. 

#### To migrate your SimpleX Chat data from your old device to your new device:

1. [Open the app settings menu](./app-settings.md#opening-the-app-settings-menu) on your old device.

2. Click or tap **Migrate to another device**. 

3. Enter your database passphrase. Otherwise, you'll be prompted to set one if you haven't already.

4. Click or tap **Archive and upload**. An archive link and QR code will be generated. 

5. Download and install SimpleX Chat on your new device. Open it and then tap **Migrate from another device**. You have two options to start the migration process:
   
   - Scan the QR code on the old device.
   
   - Share the archive link from the old device and then paste it into the new device. 

6. Once the migration is complete, tap **Finalize migration** on the old device and your data will be wiped from there. 

## Settings

Here in this section: you can configure notifications, configure connections to servers (including SMP servers, XFTP servers and WebRTC ICE servers) and network settings, configure audio and video calls, configure privacy and security, change the app's appearance and manage your SimpleX Chat data.

### Notifications

This screen allows you to configure notifications and notification previews. For more details on how notifications work in Android versus iOS, please read [this blog post](../../blog/20220404-simplex-chat-instant-notifications.md).

#### To configure notifications on Android:

1. [Open the app settings menu](#opening-the-app-settings-menu).
2. Click or tap **Notifications**.
3. Click or tap **Notification service**. 
4. Choose from the following options:
   - `Runs when app is open` - The app will receive notifications only when it's running.
   - `starts periodically` - The app will periodically check for new notifications every 10 minutes for up to 1 minute.
   - `always on` - The app will always check for new notifications, even when it's closed. 

**Please note**: For instant and periodic notifications to work on Android, you need to disable power optimization when prompted by the app, or later via the app settings. Also, some variants of Android require additional settings to be configured. For example, MIUI on Xiaomi phones require you to enable "Auto start" for the notification service to work. Please read the [Don't kill my app](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) guide for any additional settings that may be required on your device. Also, instant notifications have the highest battery consumption - we are working to reduce it to be less or the same as for periodic notifications.

#### To configure notifications on iOS:

1. [Open the app settings menu](#opening-the-app-settings-menu).
2. Click or tap **Notifications**.
3. Click or tap **Send notifications**.
4. Choose from the following options:
   - `Instantly (Recommended)` - device token and notifications are sent to SimpleX Chat's notification server, but not the message content, size or who it is from. 
   - `Periodically (More private)` - check new messages every 20 minutes. Device token is shared with SimpleX Chat server, but not how many contacts or messages you have. 
   - `Local (Most private)` - do not use SimpleX chat notifications server, check messages periodically in the background (depends on how often you use the app). 

#### To configure notification preview:

1. [Open the app settings menu](#opening-the-app-settings-menu). 
2. Click or tap **Notifications**. 
3. Click or tap **Show preview**.
4. Choose from the following options:
   - `message text` - show contact name and message.
   - `contact name` - show only contact name.
   - `hidden` - hide both contact name and message.

### Network & servers

### Privacy and security

Here you can configure all the privacy and security settings available in SimpleX Chat to suit your needs. For more details, please visit the [Privacy & Security page](./privacy-security.md).

## App

Here in this section are the Restart and Shutdown buttons (only available on Android and Desktop) and developer tools. 

### Restart and Shutdown Buttons (Android and Desktop only)

You can use these buttons to manually restart or shutdown the app. 

### Developer tools

This screen has options that are only needed for app developers and can be used to debug the app in case something is not working.

#### Chat console

Here you can see and use console commands with the chat core. None of this information is sent over the network; this is an internal communication between different parts of the app.

**WARNING:** some of the console commands can stop the app from functioning; only use them if you know what you are doing or were instructed by the team.

**Please note**: The chat console can contain what looks like errors. Unless you experience any issues in the app's UI, these "errors" should not be considered a sign of app malfunction - they are likely to be normal and expected behavior.

#### Show developer options

This option affects the visiblity of developer options in the UI. These include: [transport isolation](#transport-isolation-beta); showing database IDs for contacts, groups and group members; confirm database upgrades; show console in new window (desktop only); show internal errors and show slow API calls. 

#### Confirm database upgrades

This option affects the ability to confirm database upgrades - it is toggled off by default. The app's database is migrated to the new version without any confirmations. Starting from v4.6.2, these migrations are reversible - you can rollback to the previous version(s) of the app (not earlier than v4.6.1). If you want to be asked a confirmation every time the app's database is upgraded, you may enable this option - this is not recommended, as it happens almost on every app update, and should not cause any concerns.

#### Show console in new window (Desktop app only)

This option affects the ability to open the chat console in a new window - it is toggled on by default. 

#### Show internal errors

This option affects the visibility of internal errors - it is toggled off by default. 

#### Show slow API calls

This option affects the visibility of slow API calls - it is toggled off by default.
