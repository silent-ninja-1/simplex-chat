### Create your first chat profile

After installing SimpleX Chat:

**Please note**: Your chat profile is stored locally on your device, it is not stored anywhere else. It is only shared with your contacts. 

### Create your SimpleX address

After creating your first chat profile, the app will then ask you to create a SimpleX address. You can skip this step if you don't want to by tapping **Don't create address**. You can always create it later. 

#### To create your SimpleX address:

1. Click or tap **Create SimpleX address**.
2. (Optional) Click or tap **Share** to share your SimpleX address with your contacts.
3. (Optional) Click or tap **Invite friends** to send an email invitation to your friends who don't have SimpleX Chat.
4. Click or tap **Continue**. 

For more details on what a SimpleX address is, how you can set it up, and what it can be used for, please visit the [Managing Connections](#simplex-address) page.

### Choose notifications mode

After you have created your first chat profile and/or SimpleX address, the app will ask you to choose how you want to receive notifications. Please read the description for each option. On iOS, it is trade-off between convenience and privacy, with instant notifications sharing more meta-data with the servers. On Android, it is a trade-off between notification delays and battery life. Once you've made your choice, tap **Use chat**. 

For more details about how notifications work on Android versus iOS, please read [this blog post](../../blog/20220404-simplex-chat-instant-notifications.md).

### Connect with friends

You can start telling your friends to download SimpleX Chat [here](https://simplex.chat/downloads/). While they're at it, create a one-time invitation for each one of them and share it either as a QR code in person or as a link from a distance. These will appear as pending connections in the main **Chats** screen after they've been created. You can optionally set a contact name for each invitation to help remember who it's for. 

#### Here's how to do it:

1. On Android or desktop, tap on the ðŸ–‰ (floating pencil) button in the bottom-right corner of the **Chats** screen. On iOS, tap on the ðŸ–‰ (pencil) button in the top-right corner of the **Chats** screen.
2. Tap or click **Add contact**. 
3. Tap or click **Share this 1-time link** to share it with your friend from a distance. Or, you can show your QR code in person for your friend to scan. 
4. (Optional) Toggle **Incognito** on to share a random profile with your friend. 
5. (Optional) Return to the **Chats** screen and then tap or click on an invitation to set a contact name.

**Tip**: you can also [create a SimpleX address](./making-connections.md#to-create-and-share-a-simplex-address) to manage your connections.

### Join some groups

There are links to join several [SimpleX user groups](../../README.md#join-user-groups) available on our GitHub page - join them to ask any questions and discuss ideas. You can also connect to our [directory service](https://simplex.chat/contact/#/?v=1-4&smp=smp%3A%2F%2Fu2dS9sG8nMNURyZwqASV4yROM28Er0luVTx5X1CsMrU%3D%40smp4.simplex.im%2FeXSPwqTkKyDO3px4fLf1wx3MvPdjdLW3%23%2F%3Fv%3D1-2%26dh%3DMCowBQYDK2VuAyEAaiv6MkMH44L2TcYrt_CsX3ZvM11WgbMEUn0hkIKTOho%253D%26srv%3Do5vmywmrnaxalvz6wi3zicyftgio6psuvyniis6gco6bp6ekl4cqj4id.onion) and search for more user-managed groups to join there.

#### To join a group via link:

1. Get a group link either from your contacts or groups, or by finding one online.

2. Options:
   
   - Click or tap on the QR code symbol in the right-hand side of the search bar on the **Chats** screen. Scan QR code or paste group link to join.
   
   - Paste the group link into the searchbar towards the top of the **Chats** screen. You'll be prompted to share your current chat profile or an incognito profile.
   
   - Click or tap on the group link you received from them and you'll be prompted to share your current chat profile or an incognito profile with them.

### Connect with the SimpleX Chat team

While you're waiting for your friends to accept your invitations, you can connect with the SimpleX Chat team right from the main **Chats** screen. You can tap on their contact card to connect with them and ask any questions or just to test the app - feel free to send any test messages. 

#### To connect with the SimpleX Chat team later:

1. [Open the app settings menu](./app-settings.md#opening-the-app-settings-menu).
