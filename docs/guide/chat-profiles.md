# Your chat profiles

Since SimpleX Chat doesn't require any user ID's, there are no user accounts required to use it. Instead, you use chat profiles. A name is all you need to create one. They are stored locally on your device and only shared with your contacts. SimpleX servers have zero knowledge of them. Click or tap on the following sections to learn more:

## Migrating your chat profiles to another device

There are two methods to migrate your chat profiles from your old device to another device:

- Upload Archive to SimpleX File Servers and Scan QR Code/Paste File Link

- Manual Export and Import Archive

### Upload Archive to SimpleX File Servers and Scan QR Code/Paste File Link

This method is recommended for most users. It creates a zipped archive containing all your data and uploads it across several SimpleX file servers. A QR code and file link are generated afterwards. 

#### On your old device:

1. [Open the app settings menu](./app-settings.md#opening-the-app-settings-menu).

2. Click or tap **Migrate to another device**.

3. If you haven't setup a database passphrase yet, you'll be prompted to set one. Once you're done, tap or click **Set passphrase**. A window will appear confirming that your database is now encrypted. Tap or click **Ok**. If you already have a database passphrase, enter it and tap or click **Verify passphrase**.

4. Click or tap **Archive and upload**. 

5. Show QR code or share file link to your new device. 

#### On your new device:

1. Download and install SimpleX Chat. 

2. Open the app. 

3. Click or tap **Migrate from another device**. 

4. Scan QR code on the old device or paste the file link from the old device. 

#### On your old device:

1. Click or tap **Finalize migration**.

2. Options:
   
   - `Start chat (Not recommended)` - Using SimpleX Chat with the same database on multiple devices is currently unsupported and will cause message delivery failures. 
   
   - `Delete database from this device (Recommended)` - Deleting the database from your old device will avoid message delivery failures on your new device.  

### Manual Export and Import Archive

This method is recommended for advanced users.

#### On your old device:

1. [Open the app settings menu](./app-settings.md#opening-the-app-settings-menu).
2. Click or tap **Database passphrase & export**.
3. Toggle **Chat is running** off to stop SimpleX Chat from running.
4. Click or tap **Stop** in the confirmation dialog.
5. Confirm it with a fingerprint or PIN, in case you have [SimpleX Lock](./app-settings.md#simplex-lock) toggled on.
6. If you didn't set it before, [set a passphrase](./managing-data.md#database-passphrase) in "Database passphrase". Initially, the database is encrypted with a random passphrase that is stored in KeyChain (iOS) or with KeyStore (Android).
7. Click or tap **Export database** - it won't allow exporting unless you have set a passphrase.
8. Save the file on your device or share it via any available option.

#### On your new device:

1. [Install SimpleX Chat](./README.md#install-simplex-chat).
2. Migrate the exported .zip file over to the new device.
3. Create a chat profile with any name by following the steps in [Create your first chat profile](#create-your-first-chat-profile) â€“ you will replace it soon.
4. [Open app settings](./app-settings.md#opening-app-settings).
5. Click or tap **Database passphrase & export**.
6. Toggle **Chat is running** off to stop chat.
7. Click or tap **Stop** in the confirmation dialog.
8. Click or tap **Import database**.
9. Select the .zip file containing your exported SimpleX Chat data.
10. Click or tap **Import** in the confirmation dialog.
11. Toggle **Chat is running** on to start the chat or close and restart the app â€“ you will be prompted to enter the passphrase for your chat database.

**Please note:**

1. You can't migrate your chat profiles individually; only the whole database containing all your chat profiles can be migrated.

2. To avoid disrupting your connections, you must NOT use your exported database on more than one device at a time, and you must always use the most recent backup of your database. 

3. There is no way to recover a lost or stolen database passphrase. Please make sure to store it safely and securely.

## Incognito mode

<img src="../../blog/images/20240124-connect1.png" width="330"> <img src="../../blog/images/20240124-connect2.png" width="330"> <img src="../../blog/images/20230925-incognito.png" width="330"> <img src="../../blog/images/20220901-incognito3.png" width="330">

With Incognito mode, you can protect the privacy of your chat profile from new contacts you don't know or trust by sharing a random name and empty profile picture instead. This allows you to have as many anonymous connections without any shared data between them in a single chat profile. You can enable it at the point of connection when someone shares a 1-time link, SimpleX address or a group link with you. 

#### To share an incognito profile with a 1-time link:

1. On Android, tap on the ðŸ–‰ (floating pencil) button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. On iOS, tap on the ðŸ–‰ (pencil) button in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Click or tap **Add contact**.
3. Click or tap **Incognito** on.
4. Click or tap **Share 1-time link** to share with your contact from a distance. Or, you can show your QR code in person for your contact to scan.

#### To share an incognito profile with a SimpleX address:

1. [Open the app settings menu](./app-settings.md#opening-the-app-settings-menu).
2. Click or tap **Your SimpleX address**. 
3. Click or tap **Create SimpleX address**, if it hasn't been created already. 
4. Toggle **Auto-accept** on. 
5. Toggle **Accept Incognito** on. 

#### To create a group with an incognito profile:

1. On Android, tap on the ðŸ–‰ (floating pencil) button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. On iOS, tap on the ðŸ–‰ (pencil) button in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Click or tap **Create group**.
3. Enter group name. 
4. Toggle **Incognito**.
5. Click or tap **Create group**. 

**Please note**: you won't be able to directly invite your contacts; they can only join your group via your group link. 

#### To share an incognito profile when connecting via link:

1. On the main **Chats** screen, tap on the QR code symbol in the right-hand side of the search bar. Scan QR Code or paste link. Or tap or click on a SimpleX link. 
2. Click or tap **Use new incognito profile**.
